    <h1>About the Spam Classifier</h1>
    <div class="about-content">
        <h2>Project Information</h2>
        <p>This is a machine learning-based Email/SMS spam classifier that can identify whether a message is spam or not.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The system uses a trained machine learning model to classify messages. Here's the process:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Text Preprocessing</strong>: When you enter a message, it's first cleaned and preprocessed.</li>
            <li><strong>Feature Extraction</strong>: The preprocessed text is converted into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.</li>
            <li><strong>Classification</strong>: These features are fed into the machine learning model which predicts if the message is spam or not.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Flask - Web framework</li>
            <li>NLTK - For natural language processing</li>
            <li>Scikit-learn - For machine learning algorithms</li>
            <li>HTML/CSS - For the user interface</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Model Performance</h2>
        <p>The spam classification model was trained on a dataset of labeled spam and non-spam messages. The model achieves high accuracy in identifying spam messages.</p>
